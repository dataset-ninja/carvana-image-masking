**The Carvana Image Masking Dataset**, presented as part of a computer vision challenge on the Kaggle platform, offered a unique opportunity for participants to tackle complex image segmentation tasks. Provided by [Carvana](https://www.carvana.com/), an online car retail company, this dataset consisted of high-resolution car images. The challenge tasked participants with the development of algorithms capable of automatically and precisely identifying cars within these images and generating pixel-level masks to outline the cars' shapes.

This dataset contains a large number of car images (as .jpg files). Each car has exactly 16 images, each one taken at different angles. Each car has a unique id and images are named according to id_01.jpg, id_02.jpg â€¦ id_16.jpg. In addition to the images, you are also provided some basic metadata about the car make, model, year, and trim.
